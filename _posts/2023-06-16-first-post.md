## A whole new site!

Hey! If you're reading this that means I successfully made this blog and the domain is pointing at it correctly!

Prior to this I had a Squarespace site that was too expensive to maintain so I looked around and decided it was time to try making something on my own. 
Admittedly, I'm not familiar with the tools and languages that this template uses so I have a whole lot of learning ahead of me!

### Going forward

I'm going to post portfolio images here along with commentary and information about the process. You can expect to see plenty of postmortems and the occasional WIP.
